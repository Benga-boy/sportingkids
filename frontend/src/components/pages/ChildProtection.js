It is accepted that the FA aims to prevent people with a history of relevant and significant offending from having contact with children or young people and the opportunity to influence policies or practice with children or young people.

            <li>Any adult or young person with concerns about a colleague or coach can go direct to the police, social services or the NSPCC. Sporting kids encourages everyone to know about these measures and utilise them if necessary.</li>

            <li>Video taking and Photographs – All staff should be vigilant when it comes to photos and video being taken. We do not intend to ban the use of cameras and video in order to analyse coaching and to promote the club.

It is therefore required that parents seek permission from Sporting kids before taking such photographs or video. For more detailed information please see our Photo and Video Policy. In order to avoid ‘grooming’ photographs used by Sporting kids will never be assisted by full names that will assist a third party in identifying the child.</li>
