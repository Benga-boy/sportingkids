                <h3>Breakfast Club</h3>
                <p>
                  Starting the day with physical activity helps to improve focus, mood and confidence for the day
                  ahead. We can be flexible to the needs of the school and pupils through offering alternatives to
                  sports such as board games, puzzles and a place to read and write in our ‘relaxation areas’.
                </p>
                <h3>Lunchtime Club</h3>
                <p>
                  We understand that lunch time can be a challenging time of the day for pupils and school staff. To
                  help ease the pressure, we offer lunchtime supervision, school team training and organised games to
                  encourage pupils to engage in positive activities during their lunch break.
                </p>
                <h3>After School Club</h3>
                <p>
                  As well as providing childcare in a safe environment, our after-school clubs give pupils the chance to
                  further develop their skills in a particular sport or multi-sport sessions. With certificates and prizes to
                  be won, our after-school clubs are a hit with pupils and working families alike.
                </p>
                <h3>PE Lessons / PPA Cover</h3>
                <p>
                  We know how vital PPA time is and how expensive and time-consuming managing external cover
                  can be. This is considered when tailoring our PPA packages so we can offer affordable cover and
                  make valuable use of your Primary PE and Sport Premium funding budgets.<br /><br />
                  By choosing Sporting Kids for your PPA cover and PE lessons, you can rest assured that we will
                  provide your school with the following benefits:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A cost-effective service</li>
                  <li>Quality lessons in line with PE curriculum objectives</li>
                  <li>Effective differentiation to enable progression for all abilities</li>
                  <li>Staff continuity</li>
                  <li>Termly or half-termly assessments and feedback</li>

                <h3>Wellbeing Workshops</h3>
                <p>
                  Sporting Kids have experience of working in a range of settings including SEN provisions, youth clubs
                  and Pupil Referral Units. Through working with children and young people with social, emotional and
                mental health needs we have developed our Wellbeing Workshops.<br /><br />
                These workshops incorporate mentoring sessions, discussion-based activities and mental health
                awareness alongside promoting the importance of keeping active through sports.

                    The Sporting Kids coaches put on fantastic sports sessions for the young people attending our summer programme. Over the 10 sessions they built positive professional relationships with the kids, which I haven’t seen other sports coaches do with such success- it proved to be a valuable approach which set them apart from sport companies I have previously worked with. I look forward to working with you again in the near future
